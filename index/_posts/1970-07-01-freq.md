## Where can I get a copy of HTML Tidy?

It’s probable that you already have an outdated version of **HTML Tidy**. It
comes pre-installed on Mac OS X and many distributions of GNU/Linux and other
UNIX-type operating systems.

You can always access the source code on our [Github repository](1) to guarantee
that you always have the cutting-edge version.


## How can I report bugs or make feature requests?

If you have a github account (easy and free) we encourage you to make bug
reports and feature requests in our [issues tracker](3).


## How can I contribute to **Tidy**’s development?

We welcome code, website, and documentation contributions, and you are invited
to join our open community. You can make pull requests for changes you make
[in our github repo](4).
