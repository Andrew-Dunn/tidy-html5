Get Tidy
========

You may already have **Tidy** on your computer! Many operating systems ship with
the `tidy` command pre-installed. Chances are good, though, that what you have
is so outdated that it doesnâ€™t even recognize HTML5.

Currently to get **Tidy** for the first time or to update your current
installation you should grab the source code from its [github repository][1].

Currently the HTACG team is working hard putting the finishing touches on the
new, stable version of **Tidy**, but you can be sure that we are developing
solutions to provide binaries for your operating system as well as distribution
through all of the common Linux/Mac software repositories.
